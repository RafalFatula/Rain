# Rain
This is just a bunch of rectangles falling from the top of the canvas. Idea taken from a youtube video. I wanted to see a difference between graphic libraries in c++ and compare it (SFML) to Allegro.
# "How to play"
You can choose from 4 actions: press right/left arrow to increase/decrease amount of rain droplets, or up/down to increase/decrease speed of falling.
